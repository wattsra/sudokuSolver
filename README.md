# A simple Sudoku solver app.

The Sudoku puzzle to be solved is already hard coded into the app. This can be changed if required. Open sudokusolver.py and update the variable "bo".

*I had this idea originally from Tim on the "Tech by Tim" YouTube channel.*

**Edit Sudoku information on line 1 of sudoku.py**
 
    
    bo =[
    [6,9,2,3,4,5,8,7,1],
    [1,8,5,7,2,6,3,4,0],
    [0,0,7,8,9,0,0,5,6],
    [0,6,0,0,7,0,1,0,0],
    [4,0,3,1,6,2,0,0,8],
    [9,0,1,0,3,0,7,6,4],
    [0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,7],
    [2,3,0,6,0,0,9,0,0],
    [7,1,0,0,5,4,0,0,3],
    ]
